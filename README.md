# DipCoin Smart Contract Core v1(Move Implementation on SUI Chain)
GitHub Repository Introduction: DipCoin Smart Contract v1 (Move Implementation on SUI Chain)

This repository represents the first version of DipCoin's smart contract, implemented using the Move programming language and deployed on the SUI blockchain. The smart contract is designed to support Spot AMM (Average Market Model) swaps and perpetual contracts, enabling users to trade directly on the blockchain with high throughput and low latency.

The implementation leverages the advanced features of the Move language, which is optimized for asset-oriented programming, making it ideal for executing complex financial transactions on a scalable and secure blockchain platform like SUI. The smart contract is modular in design, allowing for easy integration with wallets, exchanges, and other decentralized applications (DApps) in the ecosystem.

## Key features of this implementation include:

- Spot AMM Support: Enable direct trading of assets using the AMM model, providing liquidity and order book functionality.
- Perpetual Contracts: Allow users to trade with leverage, replicating traditional derivatives markets on a blockchainï¼ˆQ3,2025).
- Move Optimization: Utilizes Move's unique asset-centric design to optimize performance and resource usage.
SUI Chain Integration: Built specifically for the SUI blockchain, taking advantage of its high-speed transactions and interoperability features.
- This repository is an essential component for developers interested in building decentralized trading applications or integrating AMM and perpetual swap functionalities into their platforms. It serves as a foundation for further development and innovation in the realm of blockchain-based financial instruments.

## 2025 Roadmap for DipCoin Smart Contract Development
### Q2: Spot AMM Deployment
#### Core Tasks:

- Smart Contract Logic Design & Implementation:
> Implement asset storage functionality to efficiently manage multiple trading pairs.
Develop order matching algorithms, such as Projection Sorting (Projections Sorting), to efficiently match buy and sell orders.
Design a price determination model that selects the optimal price based on current market conditions.

- User Interface Design & Development:
> Create an intuitive trading interface to streamline operations.
Provide real-time price display, order execution status feedback, and asset balance queries.

- Expected Outcomes:
> Successful deployment of the Spot AMM smart contract with basic trading functionalities, including limit orders and market orders.
> A user-friendly interface that enables test users to easily navigate and execute trades.

- Potential Challenges:
> Order Matching Efficiency: Addressing high-frequency trading demands while avoiding system performance bottlenecks.
> Price Determination Models: Selecting a price model that maintains market liquidity without susceptibility to price manipulations.
> User Experience Optimization: Ensuring the interface is responsive and provides a seamless trading experience.

### Q3: Perpetual Contracts Deployment
#### Core Tasks:

- Perpetual Contract Logic Design & Implementation:
> Develop automated margin call and liquidation mechanisms to ensure risk management compliance.
Implement strategies to match the price movements of Spot assets for perpetual contracts.
Enhance market depth and liquidity through order book optimization.

- QoS (Quality of Service) Enhancement:
> Improve transaction processing capabilities to handle high volumes.
Optimize smart contract execution time for better performance.

- Margin Monitoring & Risk Management:
> Establish mechanisms to monitor and manage margin levels in real-time.
Implement safeguards against potential market abuses, such as flash crashes.

- Expected Outcomes:
